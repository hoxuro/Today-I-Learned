<h2>What is Today I Learned!?</h2>
<p>Today I Learned is a full stack web app from the Jonas Schmedtmann crash course. This course has helped me to learn how to use Supabase a set of backend cloud computing services that are used to create relational databases in postgresql quickly and easily. I've also learned how to use React in a basic way with things like create-react-app or creating a build of a project. </br>
Before this course I already knew HTML, CSS and Postgresql in a solid way, so this project has helped me to put my knowledge into practice. Advanced Programming I already knew from having done projects in Java and although this project is made with JavaScript, it hasn't been difficult for me to find out how things work.</br>
Destacar√≠a estas cosas que he aprendido:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The api key must be hidden (since it was a test, I didn't do it to see what was happening) and some colleague stole the data from the database.</li>
  <li>To alter the state of the page without reloading it, we use the useState() hook.</li>
  <li>A "child" cannot exchange attributes with a "sibling" or with a "parent" attributes can only be exchanged from parent to child.</li>
</ol>
<p>A year ago I didn't know what an API was and now I can't stop using them to make applications. I like programming more and more!!!</p>
